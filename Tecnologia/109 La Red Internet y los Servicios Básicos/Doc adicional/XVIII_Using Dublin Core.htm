<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<a id="whatismetadata" name="whatismetadata"></a>
<h3>1.1. What is Metadata?</h3>
<p>Metadata has been with us since the first librarian made a list of
the items on a shelf of handwritten scrolls. The term "meta" comes from
a Greek word that denotes "alongside, with, after, next." More recent
Latin and English usage would employ "meta" to denote something
transcendental, or beyond nature. Metadata, then, can be thought of as
data about other data. It is the Internet-age term for information that
librarians traditionally have put into catalogs, and it most commonly
refers to descriptive information about Web resources.</p>
<p>A metadata record consists of a set of attributes, or elements,
necessary to describe the resource in question. For example, a metadata
system common in libraries -- the library catalog -- contains a set of
metadata records with elements that describe a book or other library
item: author, title, date of creation or publication, subject coverage,
and the call number specifying location of the item on the shelf.</p>
<p>The linkage between a metadata record and the resource it describes may take one of two forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>elements may be contained in a record separate from the item, as in the case of the library's catalog record; or</li>
<li>the metadata may be embedded in the resource itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of embedded metadata that is carried along with the
resource itself include the Cataloging In Publication (CIP) data
printed on the verso of a book's title page; or the TEI header in an
electronic text. Many metadata standards in use today, including the
Dublin Core standard, do not prescribe either type of linkage, leaving
the decision to each particular implementation.</p>
<p>Although the concept of metadata predates the Internet and the Web,
worldwide interest in metadata standards and practices has exploded
with the increase in electronic publishing and digital libraries, and
the concomitant "information overload" resulting from vast quantities
of undifferentiated digital data available online. Anyone who has
attempted to find information online using one of today's popular Web
search services has likely experienced the frustration of retrieving
hundreds, if not thousands, of "hits" with limited ability to refine or
make a more precise search. The wide scale adoption of descriptive
standards and practices for electronic resources will improve retrieval
of relevant resources in any venue where information retrieval is
critical. As noted by Weibel and Lagoze, two leaders in the fields of
metadata development and digital libraries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The association of standardized descriptive metadata with networked
objects has the potential for substantially improving resource
discovery capabilities by enabling field-based (e.g., author, title)
searches, permitting indexing of non-textual objects, and allowing
access to the surrogate content that is distinct from access to the
content of the resource itself." (Weibel and Lagoze, 1997)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last years we have also seen an increase in the application
of Dublin Core metadata in more closed environments. There are
implementations where Dublin Core metadata is used to describe
resources held, owned or produced by companies, governments and
international organisations to supporting portal services or internal
knowledge management. There are also implementations where Dublin Core
metadata is used as a common exchange format supporting the aggregation
of collections of metadata, such as the case of the Open Archive
Initiative. In these cases, like in the open environment of the Web,
the concept of standardized descriptive metadata provides a powerful
mechanism to improve retrieval for specific applications and specific
user communities. It is this need for "standardized descriptive
metadata" that the Dublin Core addresses.</p>

<a id="whatis" name="whatis"></a>
<h3>1.2. What is the Dublin Core?</h3>
<p>The Dublin Core metadata standard is a simple yet effective element
set for describing a wide range of networked resources. The Dublin Core
standard includes two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core
comprises fifteen elements; Qualified Dublin Core includes three
additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as
a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that refine the
semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource
discovery. The semantics of Dublin Core have been established by an
international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from
librarianship, computer science, text encoding, the museum community,
and other related fields of scholarship and practice.</p>
<p>Another way to look at Dublin Core is as a "small language for
making a particular class of statements about resources". In this
language, there are two classes of terms -- elements (nouns) and
qualifiers (adjectives) -- which can be arranged into a simple pattern
of statements. The resources themselves are the implied subjects in
this language. (For additional discussion of Dublin Core Grammar, see <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/">"DCMI Grammatical Principles"</a>)
In the diverse world of the Internet, Dublin Core can be seen as a
"metadata pidgin for digital tourists": easily grasped, but not
necessarily up to the task of expressing complex relationships or
concepts.</p>
<p>The Dublin Core basic element set is outlined in <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml">Section 4</a>.
Each element is optional and may be repeated. Most elements also have a
limited set of qualifiers or refinements, attributes that may be used
to further refine (not extend) the meaning of the element. The Dublin
Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) has established standard ways to refine
elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. The
full set of <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">elements and element refinements</a> conforming to DCMI "best practice" is available, with a <a href="http://dublincore.org/dcregistry/">formal registry</a> available as well.</p>
<p>Three other Dublin Core principles bear mentioning here, as they are
critical to understanding how to think about the relationship of
metadata to the underlying resources they describe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The One-to-One Principle. In general Dublin Core metadata
describes one manifestation or version of a resource, rather than
assuming that manifestations stand in for one another. For instance, a
jpeg image of the Mona Lisa has much in common with the original
painting, but it is not the same as the painting. As such the digital
image should be described as itself, most likely with the creator of
the digital image included as a Creator or Contributor, rather than
just the painter of the original Mona Lisa. The relationship between
the metadata for the original and the reproduction is part of the
metadata description, and assists the user in determining whether he or
she needs to go to the Louvre for the original, or whether his/her need
can be met by a reproduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2. The Dumb-down Principle. The qualification of Dublin Core
properties is guided by a rule known colloquially as the Dumb-Down
Principle. According to this rule, a client should be able to ignore
any qualifier and use the value as if it were unqualified. While this
may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value
(minus the qualifier) must continue to be generally correct and useful
for discovery. Qualification is therefore supposed only to refine, not
extend the semantic scope of a property.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3. Appropriate values. Best practice for a particular element or
qualifier may vary by context, but in general an implementor cannot
predict that the interpreter of the metadata will always be a machine.
This may impose certain constraints on how metadata is constructed, but
the requirement of usefulness for discovery should be kept in mind.</p>
<p>Although the Dublin Core was originally developed with an eye to
describing document-like objects (because traditional text resources
are fairly well understood), DC metadata can be applied to other
resources as well. Its suitability for use with particular non-document
resources will depend to some extent on how closely their metadata
resembles typical document metadata and also what purpose the metadata
is intended to serve. (Implementors interested in using Dublin Core for
diverse resources are encouraged to browse the <a href="http://dublincore.org/projects/">Dublin Core Projects pages</a> for ideas on using Dublin Core metadata for their resources.)</p>
<p>Dublin Core has as its goals:</p>
<p>Simplicity of creation and maintenance</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The Dublin Core element set has been kept as small and simple as
possible to allow a non-specialist to create simple descriptive records
for information resources easily and inexpensively, while providing for
effective retrieval of those resources in the networked environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commonly understood semantics</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Discovery of information across the vast commons of the Internet is
hindered by differences in terminology and descriptive practices from
one field of knowledge to the next. The Dublin Core can help the
"digital tourist" -- a non-specialist searcher -- find his or her way
by supporting a common set of elements, the semantics of which are
universally understood and supported. For example, scientists concerned
with locating articles by a particular author, and art scholars
interested in works by a particular artist, can agree on the importance
of a "creator" element. Such convergence on a common, if slightly more
generic, element set increases the visibility and accessibility of all
resources, both within a given discipline and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>International scope</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The Dublin Core Element Set was originally developed in English, but versions are being created in <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/">many other languages</a>, including Finnish, Norwegian, Thai, Japanese, French, Portuguese, German, Greek, Indonesian, and Spanish. <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/languages/">The DCMI Localization and Internationalization Special Interest Group</a> is coordinating efforts to link these versions in a distributed registry.</p>
<p>Although the technical challenges of internationalization on the
World Wide Web have not been directly addressed by the Dublin Core
development community, the involvement of representatives from
virtually every continent has ensured that the development of the
standard considers the multilingual and multicultural nature of the
electronic information universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extensibility</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>While balancing the needs for simplicity in describing digital
resources with the need for precise retrieval, Dublin Core developers
have recognized the importance of providing a mechanism for extending
the DC element set for additional resource discovery needs. It is
expected that other communities of metadata experts will create and
administer additional metadata sets, specialized to the needs of their
communities. Metadata elements from these sets could be used in
conjunction with Dublin Core metadata to meet the need for
interoperabilbility. The DCMI Usage Board is presently working on a
model for accomplishing this in the context of "application profiles."</p>
<p>Rachel Heery and Manjula Patel, in their article <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue25/app-profiles/">"Application profiles: mixing and matching metadata schemas"</a> define an application profile as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" ... schemas which consist of data elements drawn from one or more
namespaces, combined together by implementors, and optimised for a
particular local application."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model allows different communities to use the DC elements for
core descriptive information, and allowing domain specific extensions
which make sense within a more limited arena.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a id="purpose" name="purpose"></a>
<h3>1.3. The Purpose and Scope of This Guide</h3>
<p>This document is intended to be an entry point for users of Dublin
Core. For non-specialists, it will assist in creating simple
descriptive records for information resources (for example, electronic
documents, JPEG images, video clips). Specialists may find the document
a useful point of reference to the documentation of Dublin Core, as it
changes and grows.</p>
<p>"Using Dublin Core" will show in a non-technical fashion how Dublin
Core metadata may be used by anyone to make their material more
accessible. It discusses the principles, structure and content of
Dublin Core metadata elements, how to use them in composing a complete
Dublin Core metadata record, as well as how to qualify elements to
support use by a wide variety of communities.</p>
<p>Another important goal of this document is to promote "best
practices" for describing resources using the Dublin Core element set.
The Dublin Core community recognizes that consistency in creating
metadata is an important key to achieving optimal retrieval and
intelligible display across disparate sources of descriptive records.
Inconsistent metadata effectively hides desired records, resulting in
uneven, unpredictable or incomplete search results.</p>

<p>As a general introduction, this document is necessarily brief, and
cannot address all the issues implementors may encounter while planning
their use of metadata. Several avenues remain for those who have
additional questions beyond those addressed in this guide.</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Appended to this guide are references to relevant articles and
other resources, including those with more technical guidance for
implementors</li>
<li>The Dublin Core Website contains references to additional documents
and resources of the DCMI community and ways for implementors to become
involved in the DCMI</li>
<li>Specific questions can be addressed to <a href="http://askdcmi.askvrd.org/">AskDCMI</a>.
In addition to fielding questions, the AskDCMI service maintains a
searchable archive of already answered questions and links to
additional resources.</li>

<h3>2. Syntax Issues</h3>
<p><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/">The Dublin Core Abstract Model</a>
provides a reference model against which particular DC encoding
guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding
syntax. Such a reference model allows implementors to gain a better
understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode
and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations
between different syntaxes. Although the document is primarily aimed at
the developers of software applications that support Dublin Core
metadata, anyone who is considering implementing Dublin Core --
particularly those contemplating extending DC in any way -- could
usefully review the document. Those involved in developing new syntax
encoding guidelines for Dublin Core metadata or developing metadata
application profiles based on the Dublin Core should also become
familiar with the DC Abstract Model.</p>
<p>In this guide, we have chosen to represent Dublin Core examples in a
"generic" form (Element="value"). Examples of other syntaxes,
including: HTML or XHTML (the Web's Hypertext Markup Language format),
RDF/XML (the Resource Description Framework using eXtensable Markup
Language) and in plain XML can be found in syntax-specific <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/expressions/">documents available on the DCMI Website</a>. Some are also referenced within this document and in the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/bibliography.shtml">Bibliography Section</a> of this guide.</p> <p>Syntax
choices depend on a number of variables, and "one size fits all"
prescriptions rarely apply. When considering an appropriate syntax, it
is important to note that Dublin Core concepts and semantics are
designed to be syntax independent, are equally applicable in a variety
of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for
interpretation both by search engines and by human beings.</p>

<a id="html" name="html"></a>
<h3>2.1. HTML and XHTML</h3>
<p>HTML or XHTML can be used to express either simple or qualified
Dublin Core, although there are limitations inherent in representing
refinements in HTML. Specific instructions for expressing Dublin Core
in HTML can be found in the following DCMI document:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/">Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in HTML/XHTML meta and link elements</a></li>
</ol>

<a id="rdfxml" name="rdfxml"></a> 
<h3>2.2. RDF/XML</h3>
<p>RDF (Resource Description Framework) allows multiple metadata
schemes to be read by humans as well as parsed by machines. It uses XML
(EXtensible Markup Language) to express structure thereby allowing
metadata communities to define the actual semantics. This decentralized
approach recognizes that no one scheme is appropriate for all
situations, and further that schemes need a linking mechanism
independent of a central authority to aid description, identification,
understanding, usability, and/or exchange.</p>
<p>RDF allows multiple objects to be described without specifying the
detail required. The underlying glue, XML, simply requires that all
namespaces be defined and once defined, they can be used to the extent
needed by the provider of the metadata.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="example">&lt;rdf:RDF 
   xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"&gt;

   &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="http://media.example.com/audio/guide.ra"&gt;

      &lt;dc:creator&gt;Rose Bush&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
      &lt;dc:title&gt;A Guide to Growing Roses&lt;/dc:title&gt;
      &lt;dc:description&gt;Describes process for planting and nurturing different kinds of rose bushes.&lt;/dc:description&gt; 
      &lt;dc:date&gt;2001-01-20&lt;/dc:date&gt;

   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt; 
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

<p>This simple example uses Dublin Core by itself to describe an audio
recording of a guide to growing rose bushes. With XML or RDF/XML,
Dublin Core can potentially be mixed with other metadata vocabularies.
For example, the simple Dublin Core description above might be used
alongside other vocabularies such as vCard that can describe the
author's affiliation and contact information, or a more specialized
"rose description" vocabulary that described the rose bushes in greater
detail.</p>
<p>DCMI has made available several recommendations specifically about using these syntaxes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/">Guidelines for Implementing Dublin Core in XML</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml/">Expressing Simple Dublin Core in RDF/XML</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml/">Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF/XML</a> (Proposed Recommendation)</li>
</ol>

<a id="metadatacontained" name="metadatacontained"></a>
<h3>2.3. Metadata Storage and Maintenance Issues</h3>
<p>Some implementations using Dublin Core have chosen to embed their
metadata within the resource itself. This approach is taken most often
with documents encoded using HTML, but is also sometimes possible with
other kinds of documents. Simple tools have been developed to make
provision of Dublin Core metadata within HTML encoded pages fairly
easy. One such tool, <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/">DC.dot</a>,
extracts metadata information from an HTML document, and formats it so
that it can be edited, then cut and pasted back into the HTML header of
the original document.</p>
<p>On the other hand, metadata can be stored in any kind of database,
and provide a link to the described resource rather than be embedded
within it. This approach is likely to be most practical for many
non-textual resources, and is increasingly used for text as well,
primarily to support easier maintenance and sharing of metadata.</p>
<p>Each of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages,
and the balance point changes as implementations become larger and more
diverse, and also as the metadata ages over time.</p>

<a id="basicprinciples" name="basicprinciples"></a> 
<h3>3. Element Content and Controlled Vocabularies</h3>
<p>Each Dublin Core element is optional and repeatable, and there is no
defined order of elements. The ordering of multiple occurrences of the
same element (e.g., Creator) may have a significance intended by the
provider, but ordering is not guaranteed to be preserved in every user
environment. Ordering or sequencing may be syntax dependent; for
instance, RDF/XML supports ordering, but HTML does not.</p>
<p>Content data for some elements may be selected from a "controlled
vocabulary," which is a limited set of consistently used and carefully
defined terms. This can dramatically improve search results because
computers are good at matching words character by character but weak at
understanding the way people refer to one concept using different
words, i.e. synonyms. Without basic terminology control, inconsistent
or incorrect metadata can profoundly degrade the quality of search
results. For example, without a controlled vocabulary, "candy" and
"sweet" might be used to refer to the same concept. Controlled
vocabularies may also reduce the likelihood of spelling errors when
recording metadata.</p>
<p>One cost of a controlled vocabulary is the necessity for an
administrative body to review, update and disseminate the vocabulary.
For example, the US Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and the
US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are
formal vocabularies, indispensable for searching rigorously cataloged
collections. However, both require significant support organizations.
Another cost is having to train searchers and creators of metadata so
that they know when using MeSH, for example, to enter "myocardial
infarction" instead of the more colloquial "heart attack." More
sophisticated implementations can make such tasks much easier, but the
controlled vocabulary terms must be available for them to apply.</p>
<p>Using controlled vocabularies can be done most effectively using <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#H4">encoding schemes</a>.
Without an encoding scheme specifically designated, a subject which
might very well be carefully selected from a particular controlled
vocabulary cannot be distinguished from a simple keyword.</p>
